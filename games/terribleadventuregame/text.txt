This is you. -> ._.
You are a STUDENT in high school. As a SOPHOMORE, your life is one of constant struggle filled with agonizing ordeals known as WALKS IN THE PARK.
You live in a middling city called BELLEVUE, which is near a large metropolis known to the cultured as SEATTLE.
You are SHORT, which is unlike your BROTHER, who is TALL. You are going through POO-BERTY, so your parents reassure you that this will NOT LAST. You don't care either way.
You are CHINESE, but that doesn't matter as you can't speak it very well. People can still understand you, but you sound like a CHILD in kindergarten to them.
(The mess of objects) Atop this drawer sits a COLLECTION of objects from ages bygone. This collection used to be a MESS, but your mom cleaned it up for you.
(The MIC Masters trophy) The shortest in a series of short trophies, this TROPHY reminds you of the fact that your MATH abilities have peaked two years ago.
(The phone) Your PHONE is a (gasp) four-year-old Samsung Galaxy S5. The 5 stands for 2015, when YOUR MOM probably handed it down to you.
(The computer) You own three LAPTOPS, of which two are OLD, two are PORTABLE, and two are PERSONAL. None of them have all three traits.
(The sofa part) This salmon-colored SOFA PART used to be part of a SECTIONAL, but it got replaced with shinier leather ones. You preserved this for POSTERITY.
