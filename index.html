						I found a 6th grade class picture of some school in 1985-1986.
						There also was no swimming today due to a meet that I didn't go to.
						Piano class this morning was spent on one of the Nouvelles ï¿½tudes.
						Yesterday's homecoming game was sad. We lost 6-7. At the end we did a "VOTE" picture.
