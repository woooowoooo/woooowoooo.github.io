# woooowoooo.github.io
This is the source code of my personal website, [woooowoooo.github.io](https://woooowoooo.github.io/).

There are some pretty cool things here, like some color palettes at the [themes page](https://woooowoooo.github.io/themes.html) (view [source code](themes.html)).

This website also currently includes a few [games](https://woooowoooo.github.io/selector.html) currently in development.

You can check out my to-do list [here](to-do.md).

## Beginnings
This website started as an AP Human Geography project.
The main reason this website uses GitHub Pages is that it was free and by a reputable company.
Unfortunately, by the time I had started this repository, my partner had already settled on Google Sites.
You can check out the failed project in the earliest few commits to this repo.
