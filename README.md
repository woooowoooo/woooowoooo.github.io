# woooowoooo.github.io
This is the source code of my personal website, [woooowoooo.github.io](https://woooowoooo.github.io/).
I decided to build a website for an AP (Advanced Placement) Human Geography project. As I was searching for free hosting and domains, I found [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github Pages comes with the bonus of version control, and since I don't care about having private source code and don't need a dynamic website, this website is based on Github Pages. You can check out the failed project in the earliest few commits to this repo.

There are some pretty cool things here, like some color palettes at the [themes page](https://woooowoooo.github.io/themes.html) (view [source code](themes.html)).

This website also currently includes a few [games](https://woooowoooo.github.io/selector.html) currently in development.

You can check out my to-do list [here](to-do.md).
