This is the source code of my personal website, [woooowoooo.github.io](https://woooowoooo.github.io).
I decided to build a website for an AP Human Geography project. As I was searching for free hosting and domains, I found [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can check out the failed project in the earliest few commits to this repo.

There are some pretty cool things here, like some color palettes at the [themes page](https://woooowoooo.github.io/themes.html) (view [source code](themes.html)).

This website also currently includes a [game](https://woooowoooo.github.io/games/terribleadventuregame/tagame.html) (view [source code](games/terribleadventuregame/tagame.html)) currently in development.
As of now, here is what you can do in this "game":
* Press "p" to pause/unpause
* Press "t" to play a five-minute long track
* Press "b" to play a burp sound
